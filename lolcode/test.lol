        DIFFRINT 7 7.0

VISIBLE "Please enter number:: this is switch case test"
I HAS A numericInput
GIMMEH numericInput
numericInput IS NOW A NUMBR
BOTH SAEM numericInput AN 4, O RLY?
    YA RLY
        VISIBLE "Itz 4!"
    MEBBE BOTH SAEM numericInput AN 6
        VISIBLE "Itz 6"
    MEBBE BOTH SAEM numericInput AN 8
        VISIBLE "I think it is 8"
    NO WAI
        VISIBLE "Itz something else"
OIC

VISIBLE "Enter :"CAT:" or :"MAUS:". Test from example"

HOW DUZ I fib YR n
    BOTH SAEM n AN 0, O RLY?
        YA RLY, FOUND YR 0
    OIC
    BOTH SAEM n AN 1, O RLY?
        YA RLY, FOUND YR 1
    OIC
    I HAS A v1
    I HAS A v2
    v1 R fib DIFF OF n 1
    v2 R fib DIFF OF n 2
    SUM OF v1 AN v2, BTW no return statement, IT is returned
IF U SAY SO

I HAS A out
out R fib fibN
VISIBLE ":{fibN} fibonacci number is :{out}", BTW Formatted output

VISIBLE "Cycle. :"Hai:" ten times"
I HAS A counter ITZ 10
IM IN YR fibCycle
    VISIBLE "Hai" 
   counter R DIFF OF counter 1
   BOTH SAEM counter 0, O RLY?
       YA RLY
            GTFO
   OIC
IM OUTTA YR fibCycle


KTHXBYE
